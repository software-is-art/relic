## Core Philosophy

Relic embodies four fundamental principles:
1. **Parse Don't Validate**: Value objects as immutable witnesses of valid construction
2. **Functional-Relational Architecture**: Strict separation of essential state, logic, and effects
3. **Multiple Dispatch**: Replace control flow with type-based method selection
4. **Type-Level Relationships**: Encode constraints and relationships in the type system

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Choices

- **Type Checker**: Bidirectional with elaboration
- **SMT Solver**: Z3 with CVC5 fallback
- **Backend**: LLVM for production, interpreter for development

### Development Process
1. **Prototype First**: Validate each concept before production implementation
2. **User Feedback**: Release previews after each major phase
3. **Dogfood Early**: Use Relic to build Relic tools
4. **Benchmark Continuously**: Performance regression tests
5. **Document Everything**: Implementation notes for contributors

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- SMT solver performance â†’ Incremental checking, caching
- Dispatch overhead â†’ Compile-time specialization  
- Query optimization complexity â†’ Start with rule-based optimizer
- Effect system usability â†’ Make effects optional initially

**Adoption Risks**:
- Learning curve â†’ Interactive tutorials, clear examples
- Ecosystem gap â†’ Strong interop, adapter libraries
- Performance doubts â†’ Public benchmarks, case studies
- Migration cost â†’ Incremental adoption path
