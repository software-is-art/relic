## Core Philosophy

Relic embodies four fundamental principles:
1. **Parse Don't Validate**: Value objects as immutable witnesses of valid construction
2. **Functional-Relational Architecture**: Strict separation of essential state, logic, and effects
3. **Multiple Dispatch**: Replace control flow with type-based method selection
4. **Type-Level Relationships**: Encode constraints and relationships in the type system

## Recent Implementation Highlights

### Why Sea of Nodes for Relic

The sea of nodes architecture is particularly well-suited for Relic due to several key alignments:

1. **Immutability â†’ SSA**: Relic's immutable values naturally map to Static Single Assignment form
2. **Parse-Don't-Validate â†’ Clear Dataflow**: Value construction boundaries create explicit dataflow edges
3. **Functional-Relational â†’ Graph-Based**: Relational operations naturally form dataflow graphs
4. **Multiple Dispatch â†’ Specialization**: Graph representation enables aggressive type-based optimization
5. **Effect Boundaries â†’ Node Classification**: Clear separation of pure computation and effects

This architecture will enable Relic to achieve near-zero overhead abstractions while maintaining its high-level guarantees.
