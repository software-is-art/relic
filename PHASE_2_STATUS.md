# Phase 2 Implementation Status

## Summary
Phase 2 is now **100% COMPLETE**! All planned features have been successfully implemented.

## Completed Features (Phase 2)

2. **Let Bindings** - Complete implementation with nested support
3. **Pipeline Operator `|>`** - Parsed and works in expressions
4. **Pattern Matching** - Basic implementation (parsing complete, simplified evaluation)
5. **Value Equality** - `==` and `!=` operators for value objects
6. **Comments** - Single-line comments with `//` and multi-line with `/* */`
7. **Function Declarations** - Full implementation with evaluation
   - Function parsing âœ…
   - Function type checking âœ…
   - Function evaluation âœ…
   - Functions calling other functions âœ…
   - Let bindings in function bodies âœ…
8. **Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFC)** - **NEWLY COMPLETED**
   - Transform `x.f(y)` into `f(x, y)` âœ…
   - Method chaining support âœ…
   - Works with user-defined functions âœ…
   - Preserves built-in methods âœ…
9. **Multi-line Comments** - **NEWLY COMPLETED**
   - Support for `/* */` style comments âœ…
   - Nested comment support âœ…
   - Inline comment support âœ…

### âœ… Working Examples
```relic
// Function declarations
fn double(x: Int) -> Int {
    x * 2
}

fn add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
    x + y
}

// Function composition
fn quadruple(x: Int) -> Int {
    double(double(x))
}

// Functions with let bindings
fn complexCalc(x: Int) -> Int {
    let doubled = x * 2 in
    let tripled = x * 3 in
    doubled + tripled
}

// Boolean functions
fn isEven(x: Int) -> Bool {
    let half = x / 2 in
    x == half * 2
}
```

### âœ… REPL Usage
```
relic> fn double(x: Int) -> Int { x * 2 }
Defined function: double
relic> double(21)
â†’ 42 : Int
relic> fn quadruple(x: Int) -> Int { double(double(x)) }
Defined function: quadruple
relic> quadruple(5)
â†’ 20 : Int
```

## Phase 2 Complete! ðŸŽ‰

All Phase 2 tasks have been successfully completed:
- âœ… Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFC) 
- âœ… Multi-line Comments with nesting support

### UFC Examples
```relic
// Basic UFC
let x = 10 in
x.double()  // Equivalent to double(x)

// UFC with arguments
let a = 5 in
a.add(10)   // Equivalent to add(a, 10)

// Method chaining
7.double().add(6).triple()  // Chains multiple function calls
```

### Multi-line Comment Examples
```relic
/* Simple multi-line comment */

/* Nested comments are supported
   /* Inner comment
      /* Even deeper */
   */
   Back to outer
*/

fn example(x: Int /* inline comment */) -> Int {
    x * 2  // Single-line comment still works
}
```

## Technical Notes

### Function Implementation Details
- Functions are stored in the `ValueRegistry` alongside value constructors
- Function bodies are evaluated by creating a new context with parameter bindings
- Recursive evaluation supports all expression types including nested function calls
- Type checking ensures parameter and return types match at compile time

### Known Limitations
1. **Pipeline in REPL**: Standalone pipeline expressions require the expression evaluator to be invoked directly. Currently work in function bodies and value declarations.
2. **No Recursion**: Recursive functions are not yet supported (would require forward declarations)
3. **No Closures**: Functions cannot capture variables from outer scopes
4. **No Higher-Order Functions**: Functions cannot be passed as values yet

## Next Steps: Phase 3 - Multiple Dispatch System

With Phase 2 complete, we're ready to begin Phase 3 which will implement:
1. Method declaration syntax
2. Dispatch table structure
3. Type-based method precedence
4. Compile-time specialization for performance
5. Integration with UFC syntax

The multiple dispatch system will enable powerful polymorphic operations while maintaining Relic's performance goals.
