# Phase 3: Multiple Dispatch Status

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on implementing a multiple dispatch system for Relic, allowing functions to be dispatched based on the runtime types of all arguments, not just the first one.

## Major Design Change: Unified Function Syntax
Based on user experience analysis and inspiration from Julia, we've decided to **unify function syntax** - eliminating the distinction between `fn` and `method`. All functions will use `fn` syntax and can potentially have multiple dispatch. See [PHASE_3_UNIFIED_SYNTAX.md](PHASE_3_UNIFIED_SYNTAX.md) for details.

## Summary
Phase 3 is now **~90% complete** with unified function syntax fully implemented! The `method` keyword is now treated as an alias for `fn`, allowing all functions to potentially have multiple dispatch. Functions can be called with both traditional and UFC syntax, and the runtime correctly dispatches to the appropriate implementation based on all argument types. Type-based precedence and compile-time ambiguity detection are implemented.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Method Declaration Syntax Design
- Designed syntax for method declarations with multiple dispatch
- Added support for parameter guards with `where` clauses
- Introduced `Any` type for generic dispatch
- Created comprehensive design document (PHASE_3_DESIGN.md)

### 2. AST Extensions
- Added `MethodDeclaration` variant to `Declaration` enum
- Created `ParameterWithGuard` struct for parameters with optional guards
- Extended AST to support method-specific constructs

### 3. Lexer Updates
- Added `Method` and `Where` keywords to token types
- Updated keyword recognition in lexer

### 4. Parser Implementation
- Implemented `parse_method_declaration` function
- Added `parse_parameter_with_guard` for parameters with guards
- Updated `parse_type` to recognize `Any` type
- Successfully parsing method declarations

### 5. Type System Extensions
- Added `Any` type to the type enum
- Created `MethodSignature` struct for method type information
- Extended `TypeEnvironment` to track methods
- Implemented `define_method` and `get_methods` functions

### 6. Type Checker Updates
- Implemented `check_method_declaration` function
- Added guard expression type checking
- Method registration in type environment

### 7. Compiler Support
- Added `compile_method_declaration` function
- Extended `ValueRegistry` to store methods
- Methods are successfully compiled and stored

### 8. Runtime Dispatch Implementation ✅
- Implemented dispatch resolution algorithm in evaluator
- Methods are selected based on exact type matching
- First-match selection strategy (for now)
- Full integration with expression evaluation

### 9. Type Checker Method Resolution ✅
- Extended `FunctionCall` handling to check both functions and methods
- Type checker now resolves method calls with proper type checking
- Error messages distinguish between missing functions and methods

### 10. UFC Integration Complete ✅
- `x.method(y)` correctly dispatches to `method(x, y)`
- Method chaining fully supported: `x.double().triple()`
- `MethodCall` expressions check methods before functions
- UFC preserves multiple dispatch semantics

### 11. REPL Support for Methods ✅
- REPL recognizes `method` keyword
- Help text updated to include method syntax
- Method construction properly handled in process_declaration

### 12. Unified Function Syntax ✅
- `method` keyword now treated as alias for `fn`
- All functions stored in unified registry
- Type checker supports multiple implementations per function name
- Evaluator automatically dispatches based on number of implementations
- Both `fn` and `method` produce identical behavior

## In Progress Tasks 🚧

### Type-Based Precedence Rules ✅
- Implemented specificity scoring for method selection
- Most specific method is now selected based on type scores
- Any type has lowest specificity (score 1) vs concrete types (score 3)
- Ambiguity detection when multiple methods have same specificity

## Pending Tasks 📋

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Add compile-time specialization
- Cache dispatch decisions
- Optimize method lookup

## Current Limitations

1. **No Member Access**: Value type fields aren't accessible in method bodies (partial support added)
2. **Single Parameter Values**: Value types still limited to single parameter
3. **No String Concatenation**: String operations not yet implemented
4. **No Subtype Dispatch**: Only exact type matches work
5. **No Parameter Guards**: Guards are parsed but not used in dispatch

## Next Steps

1. Complete member access implementation for value types
2. Implement parameter guards in dispatch
3. Add compile-time specialization for performance
4. Support for multi-parameter value types

## Test Status

- ✅ Basic method parsing works
- ✅ Multiple methods with same name can be defined
- ✅ Any type is recognized
- ✅ Method calls working with dispatch
- ✅ UFC syntax fully functional
- ✅ Method chaining works
- ❌ Member access for value types not working
- ❌ String operations need implementation
- ❌ Type precedence not implemented

## Code Examples Working

```relic
// Basic multiple dispatch (current syntax - will migrate to 'fn')
method add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
    x + y
}

method add(x: String, y: String) -> String {
    x  // String concat not yet implemented
}

// UFC syntax
5.add(10)          // Returns 15
"hi".add("bye")    // Returns "hi"

// Method chaining
method double(x: Int) -> Int { x * 2 }
method triple(x: Int) -> Int { x * 3 }

7.double().triple()  // Returns 42

// Different types, same function name
method process(x: Int) -> Int { x * 2 }
method process(x: Bool) -> Bool { !x }

process(21)    // Returns 42
process(true)  // Returns false
```

## Future Syntax (Unified Functions)

```relic
// All functions use 'fn' - compiler handles dispatch
fn add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
    x + y
}

fn add(x: String, y: String) -> String {
    x + x  // String concat when implemented
}

// Natural evolution - just add specializations
fn process(x: Int) -> Int { x * 2 }
fn process(x: Bool) -> Bool { !x }
fn process(x: Any) -> String { x.toString() }  // Fallback
```

## Phase 3 Progress: ~90% Complete

The core multiple dispatch system and unified function syntax are fully functional! 

### What's Working:
- Functions with multiple implementations can be defined using either `fn` or `method`
- Both traditional and UFC syntax work correctly
- Runtime correctly selects implementations based on argument types
- Type-based precedence ensures most specific function is called
- Compile-time ambiguity detection prevents conflicts

### Remaining Work:
1. Parameter guards in dispatch (parsed but not evaluated)
2. Performance optimizations and compile-time specialization
3. Documentation updates and migration guide
4. Deprecation warnings for `method` keyword (future)
