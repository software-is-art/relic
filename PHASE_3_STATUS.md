# Phase 3: Multiple Dispatch Status

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on implementing a multiple dispatch system for Relic, allowing methods to be dispatched based on the runtime types of all arguments, not just the first one.

## Summary
Phase 3 is now **~70% complete** with basic multiple dispatch functionality fully working! Methods can be called with both traditional and UFC syntax, and the runtime correctly dispatches to the appropriate method based on all argument types.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Method Declaration Syntax Design
- Designed syntax for method declarations with multiple dispatch
- Added support for parameter guards with `where` clauses
- Introduced `Any` type for generic dispatch
- Created comprehensive design document (PHASE_3_DESIGN.md)

### 2. AST Extensions
- Added `MethodDeclaration` variant to `Declaration` enum
- Created `ParameterWithGuard` struct for parameters with optional guards
- Extended AST to support method-specific constructs

### 3. Lexer Updates
- Added `Method` and `Where` keywords to token types
- Updated keyword recognition in lexer

### 4. Parser Implementation
- Implemented `parse_method_declaration` function
- Added `parse_parameter_with_guard` for parameters with guards
- Updated `parse_type` to recognize `Any` type
- Successfully parsing method declarations

### 5. Type System Extensions
- Added `Any` type to the type enum
- Created `MethodSignature` struct for method type information
- Extended `TypeEnvironment` to track methods
- Implemented `define_method` and `get_methods` functions

### 6. Type Checker Updates
- Implemented `check_method_declaration` function
- Added guard expression type checking
- Method registration in type environment

### 7. Compiler Support
- Added `compile_method_declaration` function
- Extended `ValueRegistry` to store methods
- Methods are successfully compiled and stored

### 8. Runtime Dispatch Implementation ✅
- Implemented dispatch resolution algorithm in evaluator
- Methods are selected based on exact type matching
- First-match selection strategy (for now)
- Full integration with expression evaluation

### 9. Type Checker Method Resolution ✅
- Extended `FunctionCall` handling to check both functions and methods
- Type checker now resolves method calls with proper type checking
- Error messages distinguish between missing functions and methods

### 10. UFC Integration Complete ✅
- `x.method(y)` correctly dispatches to `method(x, y)`
- Method chaining fully supported: `x.double().triple()`
- `MethodCall` expressions check methods before functions
- UFC preserves multiple dispatch semantics

### 11. REPL Support for Methods ✅
- REPL recognizes `method` keyword
- Help text updated to include method syntax
- Method construction properly handled in process_declaration

## In Progress Tasks 🚧

### Type-Based Precedence Rules
- Need to implement specificity ordering
- Most specific method should be selected (not just first match)
- Consider parameter type hierarchies

## Pending Tasks 📋

### 1. Ambiguity Detection
- Detect when multiple methods could match
- Provide clear error messages for ambiguous calls
- Implement precedence rules

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Add compile-time specialization
- Cache dispatch decisions
- Optimize method lookup

## Current Limitations

1. **No Type Precedence**: Currently uses first-match rather than most-specific match
2. **No Member Access**: Value type fields aren't accessible in method bodies (still an issue)
3. **Single Parameter Values**: Value types still limited to single parameter
4. **No String Concatenation**: String operations not yet implemented
5. **No Subtype Dispatch**: Only exact type matches work
6. **No Parameter Guards**: Guards are parsed but not used in dispatch

## Next Steps

1. Implement type-based precedence rules for method selection
2. Add ambiguity detection at compile time
3. Add member access for value types
4. Implement compile-time specialization for performance

## Test Status

- ✅ Basic method parsing works
- ✅ Multiple methods with same name can be defined
- ✅ Any type is recognized
- ✅ Method calls working with dispatch
- ✅ UFC syntax fully functional
- ✅ Method chaining works
- ❌ Member access for value types not working
- ❌ String operations need implementation
- ❌ Type precedence not implemented

## Code Examples Working

```relic
// Basic multiple dispatch
method add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
    x + y
}

method add(x: String, y: String) -> String {
    x  // String concat not yet implemented
}

// UFC syntax
5.add(10)          // Returns 15
"hi".add("bye")    // Returns "hi"

// Method chaining
method double(x: Int) -> Int { x * 2 }
method triple(x: Int) -> Int { x * 3 }

7.double().triple()  // Returns 42

// Different types, same method name
method process(x: Int) -> Int { x * 2 }
method process(x: Bool) -> Bool { !x }

process(21)    // Returns 42
process(true)  // Returns false
```

## Phase 3 Progress: ~70% Complete

The core multiple dispatch system is fully functional! Methods can be defined, called with traditional or UFC syntax, and the runtime correctly selects the appropriate method based on argument types. The main remaining work involves optimization, precedence rules, and edge case handling.
