# Phase 4: Functional-Relational Core Status

## Overview
Phase 4 introduces the functional-relational programming paradigm to Relic, implementing relations as the sole storage for essential state following the "Out of the Tar Pit" architecture.

## Summary
Phase 4 is **~10% complete** - AST infrastructure is in place. This phase will establish relations as first-class citizens in Relic, enabling type-safe relational operations with value objects.

### Completed So Far
- âœ… Added relation keywords to lexer (`relation`, `select`, `join`, `group`, `sort`, `on`, `by`, `key`, `foreign`, `references`)
- âœ… Created AST nodes for relation declarations (`RelationDeclaration`, `RelationField`, `RelationConstraint`)
- âœ… Created AST nodes for relational queries (`QueryExpression`, `SelectItem`, `AggregateItem`, etc.)
- âœ… Added placeholder implementations in compiler, evaluator, type checker, and specialization
- âœ… Project builds successfully with all Phase 4 infrastructure

## Planned Tasks ðŸ“‹

### 1. Essential State as Relations
- [x] Design relation type syntax with value object schemas
- [ ] Implement relations as sole storage for essential state
- [ ] Create relation types with value object schemas
- [ ] Build immutable fact storage (inspired by Datomic)
- [ ] Add time-based queries for historical data
- [ ] Enforce user-input data only in essential state

### 2. Relational Algebra with Value Types
- [ ] Implement type-safe relational operations
- [ ] Add Malloy-inspired source modeling:

### 3. Type-Level Relationships
- [ ] Encode relationships through type dependencies:
  ```relic
  value Post {
    author: User  // Direct dependency on User type
    content: String
    where author exists in Users
  }
  ```
- [ ] Replace foreign keys with type-level constraints

## Relic's Relational Algebra Principles

Relic's relational algebra is designed from first principles, leveraging the language's unique features:

1. **Pure Functional Operations** - All relational operations are pure functions that return new relations without modifying existing ones. This enables:
   - Time-travel queries by preserving all states
   - Safe concurrent operations
   - Easy reasoning about query behavior

2. **UFC Syntax for Natural Query Flow** - Queries read naturally left-to-right:
   ```relic
   users
     .where(age > 21)
     .join(orders)
     .select(name, totalSpent: sum(amount))
     .sort(totalSpent.desc())
   ```

3. **Multiple Dispatch for Extensibility** - Operations dispatch on relation types:
   ```relic
   // Optimized joins based on relation storage
   fn join(r1: HashIndexedRelation, r2: SortedRelation) -> Relation {
     // Use hash join algorithm
   }
   
   // Custom aggregates via multiple dispatch
   fn aggregate(data: Relation, op: MedianOp) -> Float {
     // User-defined median calculation
   }
   ```

4. **Value Types Throughout** - No NULL values; use value types and pattern matching:
   ```relic
   // Instead of NULL, use value types
   value OptionalAge = Some(Int) | None
   
   users
     .select(name, age: OptionalAge)
     .where(age matches Some(n) where n > 21)
   ```

5. **Temporal as First-Class** - Time is built into the relational model:
   ```relic
   // All relations automatically track history
   users.asOf("2024-01-01")
   users.history().where(field == "email")
   
   // Bitemporal queries combine valid and transaction time
   orders
     .validAt("2024-01-01")
     .transactedBefore("2024-01-15")
   ```

6. **Composability via Pipelines** - All operations compose seamlessly:
   ```relic
   let activeUsers = users.where(active == true)
   let recentOrders = orders.where(date > lastMonth)
   
   activeUsers
     |> join(recentOrders)
     |> group(by: userId)
     |> having(count() > 5)
   ```

7. **Type-Safe Schema Evolution** - Relations evolve with type safety:
   ```relic
   // Migrations are type transformations
   relation UsersV2 extends UsersV1 {
     phoneNumber: PhoneNumber  // New field with value type
     
     migrate: phoneNumber = PhoneNumber.unknown()
   }
   ```

## Design Decisions

### Syntax Design
Relations will be declared similarly to value types but with relational semantics:

```relic
relation Users {
  id: UserId,
  email: EmailAddress,
  age: Int,
  city: String
  
  key: id  // Primary key
  unique: email  // Uniqueness constraint
}

relation Orders {
  id: OrderId,
  userId: UserId,
  total: Money,
  date: Date
  
  key: id
  foreign: userId references Users.id
}
```

### Query Syntax
Queries leverage UFC syntax and pipeline operators for natural composition:

```relic
// Simple query with UFC
users.where(age > 21)

// Equivalent using pipeline
users |> where(age > 21)

// Complex query combining UFC and pipelines
users
  .where(city == "New York")
  .join(orders, on: users.id == orders.userId)
  .group(by: email)
  .select(email, totalSpent: sum(total))
  .sort(totalSpent.desc())
  .limit(10)

// Multiple dispatch enables custom operations
users
  .where(age > 21)
  .mapValues(normalizeEmail)  // Custom function via dispatch
  .distinct()

// Temporal queries are natural
users
  .asOf(yesterday)
  .where(status == "active")
  .history()
  .select(email, status, validFrom, validTo)
```

### Immutability and Time
Time is a first-class concept in Relic's relational model. Every fact is automatically versioned with both valid time (when the fact was true in the real world) and transaction time (when the fact was recorded):

```relic
// Query state at a specific point in time
users.asOf("2024-01-01").where(age > 21)

// View complete history of changes
users
  .history()
  .where(email == "user@example.com")
  .select(email, age, validFrom, validTo, transactionTime)

// Bitemporal queries
orders
  .validAt("2024-01-01")        // When the order was placed
  .transactedBefore("2024-01-15") // As known by this date
  .where(status == "completed")

// Time-travel debugging
let oldState = appState.asOf(beforeBugIntroduced)
let newState = appState.asOf(afterBugIntroduced)
oldState.difference(newState)  // See what changed

// Temporal joins
users
  .asOf(orderDate)
  .join(orders, on: users.id == orders.userId)
  .select(userName, orderTotal)
```

This temporal model enables:
- Audit trails without extra code
- Time-travel debugging
- Historical reporting
- Retroactive corrections
- Compliance with data regulations

## Success Criteria

Phase 4 will be considered complete when:
1. Relations can be declared with value type schemas
2. Basic queries (where, select) work correctly
3. Joins maintain type safety
4. Aggregation functions are implemented
5. Query composition via pipelines works
