# Phase 4: Functional-Relational Core Status

## Overview
Phase 4 introduces the functional-relational programming paradigm to Relic, implementing relations as value constructors following the "Out of the Tar Pit" architecture.

## Major Design Evolution: Relations as Value Constructors
After deep analysis, we've evolved from special relation syntax to treating relations as value constructors. This eliminates code generation and hidden magic, aligning perfectly with Relic's philosophy of "everything is a value" and "parse don't validate."

## Summary
Phase 4 is **~25% complete** - We've implemented the Relation value type, removed special syntax, and established the conceptual framework for relations as values.

### Completed So Far
- ✅ **Pivoted to relations-as-values approach** - No more special syntax or code generation
- ✅ Implemented `Relation` as a proper value type with schema and constraints
- ✅ Created basic query operations (`where`, `select`, `limit`, `count`)
- ✅ **Removed all relation-specific AST/parser/lexer code** - Cleaner architecture
- ✅ Updated examples to demonstrate the new approach
- ✅ Created `RELATIONS_AS_VALUES.md` documenting the design
- ✅ Project builds successfully with new architecture

## Current Implementation Status

### 1. Relations as Value Constructors ✅
```relic
// Instead of special syntax, relations are value constructors
value Users = relationOf({
    schema: {id: Int, name: String, email: String},
    key: "id",
    unique: ["email"]
})

// Creating relations is just calling a constructor
let users = Users([
    {id: 1, name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com"}
])
```

### 2. Query Operations as Functions (Partial)
- ✅ Designed query function signatures
- ✅ Implemented basic structure for `where`, `select`, `limit`, `count`
- 🚧 Need proper value cloning mechanism for full functionality
- ❌ Join operations not yet implemented

### 3. What's Working
- Relation value type with schema validation
- Key and unique constraint enforcement
- Immutable operations (add_row returns new relation)
- Basic query function structure

### 4. What Needs Work
- Value cloning for query operations
- The actual `relationOf` built-in function
- Integration with the evaluator
- Type inference for relations
- Join and aggregation operations

## Revised Design Philosophy

### No More Code Generation
The original approach had relations generating multiple types and functions invisibly. The new approach is explicit:

```relic
// Old: Magic generation
relation Users { ... }  // Generated User type, UsersRelation type, field constants, etc.

// New: Explicit construction
value Users = relationOf({ ... })  // Just a value constructor, no magic
```

### Benefits of the New Approach
1. **No Magic**: Everything is visible and explicit
2. **True to Philosophy**: Relations are values created by constructors
3. **Unified Type System**: No special cases in the compiler
4. **Composable**: Works with all existing Relic features
5. **Parse Don't Validate**: Constructor validates data on entry

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 4.1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- ✅ Design relations-as-values approach
- ✅ Implement Relation value type
- ✅ Remove special syntax from parser/lexer
- ✅ Create basic query operations framework

### Phase 4.2: Built-in Integration (Current Focus)
- [ ] Implement `relationOf` as a built-in function
- [ ] Add proper value cloning for queries
- [ ] Integrate with the evaluator
- [ ] Enable UFC syntax for natural query chaining

### Phase 4.3: Query Operations
- [ ] Complete `where` implementation with cloning
- [ ] Complete `select` with schema transformation
- [ ] Implement `join` with type safety
- [ ] Add aggregation functions
- [ ] Support grouping operations

### Phase 4.4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Multiple dispatch for storage strategies
- [ ] Temporal support (as-of queries)
- [ ] Query optimization
- [ ] Persistence backends

## Example Usage (When Complete)

```relic
// Define relations
value Users = relationOf({
    schema: {id: Int, name: String, age: Int},
    key: "id"
})

value Orders = relationOf({
    schema: {id: Int, userId: Int, amount: Float},
    key: "id"
})

// Create and query
let users = Users([
    {id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30},
    {id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 25}
])

let orders = Orders([
    {id: 101, userId: 1, amount: 99.99}
])

// Natural query syntax with UFC
let results = users
    |> where(u => u.age >= 25)
    |> join(orders, (u, o) => u.id == o.userId)
    |> select(["name", "amount"])
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement `relationOf` built-in** - Create the function that returns value constructors
2. **Fix value cloning** - Enable query operations to work properly
3. **Wire up evaluator** - Make relations work in the REPL
4. **Complete query operations** - Full implementation of all query functions

## Success Criteria

Phase 4 will be considered complete when:
1. Relations can be created as values using `relationOf`
2. Basic queries work: where, select, join
3. UFC syntax enables natural query chaining
4. Relations integrate with existing features
5. All tests pass
6. Documentation is complete

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Value cloning complexity** - May need to enhance ValueObject trait
2. **Type inference challenges** - Start with explicit types
3. **Performance concerns** - Focus on correctness first
4. **Integration complexity** - Incremental integration
