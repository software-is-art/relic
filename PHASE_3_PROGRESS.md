# Phase 3 Progress Update

## Latest Update: Unified Function Syntax Implementation ✅

### Unified Function Syntax (February 2025) ✅
- Implemented unified function syntax where `method` is an alias for `fn`
- All functions now stored in unified registry
- Automatic dispatch based on number of implementations
- Both `fn` and `method` keywords produce identical behavior
- Backward compatible - existing code continues to work

## Previously Completed

### 1. Type-Based Precedence Rules ✅
- Implemented specificity scoring system for method selection
- Methods are now selected based on type specificity rather than first-match
- Concrete types (Int, String, Bool, Value) get score 3
- Any type gets score 1 (least specific)
- Most specific method wins during dispatch

### 2. Compile-Time Ambiguity Detection ✅
- Added ambiguity checking when defining methods
- Prevents duplicate method definitions with identical parameter types
- Runtime dispatch also detects ambiguity when multiple methods have same specificity

### 3. Member Access Support (Partial) ✅
- Extended EvalValue enum to support value objects with fields
- Implemented member access for value types in evaluator
- Value objects can now have fields accessed via dot notation
- String type continues to support .length member

## Key Code Changes

1. **src/evaluator.rs**:
   - Added Value variant to EvalValue with type_name and fields HashMap
   - Implemented type-based scoring in `calculate_method_specificity()`
   - Enhanced method dispatch to sort by specificity and detect ambiguity
   - Extended member access to support value type fields

2. **src/typechecker.rs**:
   - Added ambiguity detection in `check_method_declaration()`
   - Prevents defining methods with identical parameter types

3. **src/compiler.rs**:
   - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to suppress warning

## Key Implementation Changes for Unified Syntax

1. **src/parser.rs**:
   - `method` keyword now parsed as alias for `fn`
   - Both produce `FunctionDeclaration` AST nodes
   - Supports parameter guards for future implementation

2. **src/types.rs**:
   - Unified storage: `HashMap<String, Vec<FunctionType>>`
   - Functions automatically collected by name
   - Backward compatible accessors for single functions

3. **src/typechecker.rs**:
   - Supports multiple implementations per function name
   - Validates no duplicate signatures
   - UFC works with unified dispatch

4. **src/evaluator.rs**:
   - `dispatch_function` handles multiple implementations
   - Automatic optimization: single impl = direct call
   - Multiple impls = dispatch with specificity scoring

5. **src/value.rs**:
   - Unified function registry storage
   - Methods converted to functions transparently

## Phase 3 Status: ~90% Complete

### Remaining Work:
1. **Parameter Guards**: Guards are parsed but not used in dispatch
2. **Compile-Time Specialization**: Performance optimizations for method dispatch
3. **Documentation**: Update all docs to reflect unified syntax

### Next Steps:
1. Implement parameter guard evaluation in dispatch
2. Add compile-time method specialization
3. Create migration guide for `method` → `fn`
4. Begin Phase 4: Functional-Relational Core
