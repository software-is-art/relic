# Phase 3 Progress Update

## Completed Today

### 1. Type-Based Precedence Rules ✅
- Implemented specificity scoring system for method selection
- Methods are now selected based on type specificity rather than first-match
- Concrete types (Int, String, Bool, Value) get score 3
- Any type gets score 1 (least specific)
- Most specific method wins during dispatch

### 2. Compile-Time Ambiguity Detection ✅
- Added ambiguity checking when defining methods
- Prevents duplicate method definitions with identical parameter types
- Runtime dispatch also detects ambiguity when multiple methods have same specificity

### 3. Member Access Support (Partial) ✅
- Extended EvalValue enum to support value objects with fields
- Implemented member access for value types in evaluator
- Value objects can now have fields accessed via dot notation
- String type continues to support .length member

## Key Code Changes

1. **src/evaluator.rs**:
   - Added Value variant to EvalValue with type_name and fields HashMap
   - Implemented type-based scoring in `calculate_method_specificity()`
   - Enhanced method dispatch to sort by specificity and detect ambiguity
   - Extended member access to support value type fields

2. **src/typechecker.rs**:
   - Added ambiguity detection in `check_method_declaration()`
   - Prevents defining methods with identical parameter types

3. **src/compiler.rs**:
   - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to suppress warning

## Phase 3 Status: ~80% Complete

### Remaining Work:
1. **Parameter Guards**: Guards are parsed but not used in dispatch
2. **Compile-Time Specialization**: Performance optimizations for method dispatch
3. **Multi-Parameter Value Types**: Currently limited to single parameter

### Next Steps:
1. Implement parameter guard evaluation in dispatch
2. Add compile-time method specialization
3. Begin Phase 4: Functional-Relational Core
